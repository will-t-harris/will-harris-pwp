This is a single page personal website I intend to use as a resource for show-casing my development skills and experience to potential employers.

## Milestone 1 Feedback
Purpose, Audience, and Goal are clear and concise. The Audience section could have used more detail. You mentioned potential employers and collaborators. It would have been a little more beneficial to describe the types of employers/collaborators. Keep this in mind for later projects. The Persona is well defined and gives a clear impression of who would be a potential visitor to your site. I look forward to seeing your content strategy and UI design concepts to come in Milestone 2α.

Your project and files are all set up to spec and your code looks great - nice work.

Your Milestone 1 passes at Tier III. You are now clear to begin work on Milestone 2α.


## Milestone 2a Feedback

- Your content strategy is clear.
- Great job on your wire frames.
- I like the simple layout with a scrolling section. 
- There are no HTML errors.
- Keep up the good work.

Milestone 2a Grade Tier 4


## Milestone 3 Feedback
- Nice job on the fixed half width section.  You might want to try increasing the padding on the top a little bit, as the negative space at the bottom of the section on smaller screen sizes looks a little strange.
- Your visual design and content are both good.
- In general, I suggest not saying "under construction" on a website, because those projects tend not to get finished and then it looks like the site never gets updated if a person comes back a few months later and sees the same thing.  Better to capture a snapshot of wherever it is right this moment. Github repos or screenshots are good for that.
- The social icons are well done.  Twitter looks like it's broken, though.
- This is excellent technical work.  Contact form works well, code is clean and readable, and there's no validation errors.
- Your git history is excellent.

Overall, this is a very well done project.  The technical aspects are excellent, and there is obvious care put into details to make the site look good and work well.  A very small niggle: your visual design is just a touch formal and dry.  The serif font, the left-align, and the limited color palette give the whole a rather staid look.  Depending on what kind of employers you are looking at, you may want to loosen that up a bit.  Small dev firms tend to be a little bit more wild and wooly, for instance.  But that's a very minor thing, and all the other aspects of the site are very good.
