This is a single page personal website I intend to use as a resource for show-casing my development skills and experience to potential employers.

## Milestone 1 Feedback
Purpose, Audience, and Goal are clear and concise. The Audience section could have used more detail. You mentioned potential employers and collaborators. It would have been a little more beneficial to describe the types of employers/collaborators. Keep this in mind for later projects. The Persona is well defined and gives a clear impression of who would be a potential visitor to your site. I look forward to seeing your content strategy and UI design concepts to come in Milestone 2α.

Your project and files are all set up to spec and your code looks great - nice work.

Your Milestone 1 passes at Tier III. You are now clear to begin work on Milestone 2α.
