		<h1>PWP Milestone 1</h1>
		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		<p>I want my PWP to show potential employers my development skills in order to get a job as a Junior Developer.  I also want to use it as a resource to show potential collaborators for independent projects (open source, small projects, etc)</p>
		<h2>Audience</h2>
		<p>Potential employers and collaborators.</p>
		<h2>Goal</h2>
		<p>To acquire full-time employment as a Junior Developer. (Websites or any other web technology...I'd really like to work on privacy software/privacy focused web browsers(firefox, brave, duck duck go) eventually)</p>
		<h2>Persona</h2>
		<img src="bob-needadev.jpg" alt="image of bob needadev" />
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Name:</strong> Bob Needadev</li>

		</ul>

			<li>Originally from small midwest town.</li>
			<li>Bachelor's Degree in Anthropology from Oberlin College in Ohio.</li>
			<li>Master's Degree in Electrical Engineering from Brown University in Rhode Island</li>
			<li>Moved to NM because of proximity to national labs, relatively low cost of living, burgeoning tech scene, and 350+ days of sun per year.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Goal in Using Site</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Wants to find a team player with strong communication/inter-personal skills, who is eager to learn, and who does not seem like they will jump ship in the first year of employment.</li>
			<li>Wants to find a dev willing to learn Python, with a strong version control workflow.  Should be comfortable using git on day one.</li>
			<li>Need to quickly find link to applicant's github and LinkedIn on first visiting the site.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Technology</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Mac power user, iMac Pro desktop at home, MacBook Pro laptop, fancy iPhone Xr, Apple Watch Series 4</li>
			<li>Works mainly with Python for data analysis/visualisation</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Hobbies/Interests</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Enjoys endurance sports: marathon runner, road cyclist, distance swimmer.  Training for the Iron Man triathlon.</li>
			<li>Avid Skier, buys the Taos Pass every year since moving to NM.</li>
			<li>Likes good food, fancy meals.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Attitude/Frustrations</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Busy with meetings and managerial duties, cannot afford to spend more than 3-5 minutes looking at an applicant before deciding whether to move forward with the interview process.</li>
			<li>Willing to hire a developer with less experience if they seem like they would fit with the company culture and be loyal to the company.</li>
			<li>Strongly wants to avoid wasting time on-boarding someone who is going to leave the company after a year or less.  Has been frustrated hiring Junior Developers in the past who have used his company simply as a stepping stone toward a 'better' position.  Really wants to find someone who will be worth the energy to train.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>User Story</h3>
		<p>As a first time user, I need to quickly determine whether this person is worth reaching out to for a phone screen and possible in-person interview.</p>
