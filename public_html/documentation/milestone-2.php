	<h2>Content Strategy</h2>
	<p><em>Welcome Page (desktop)</em> static left half of the desktop view with textured background.  Happy with how this looks so far, I think it gives a good degree of depth to the page.  Also want to include logos as links to my social media accounts in this section (github/linkedin/maybe instagram.  Want to include micro-animations for these logos from (useanimations.com)</p>
	<p><em>Welcome Text:</em> a short introduction clearly stating my name and role as a web developer.  This welcome message will be overlaid on the textured background of my welcome page.  </p>
	<p><em>About Me:</em> Two short paragraphs describing my background/history and my current interests in technology/programming.</p>
	<p><em>Get In Touch/Contact Form</em> </p>
